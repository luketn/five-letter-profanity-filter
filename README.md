This takes the Collins scrabble dictionary's five-letter words as a source, runs a profanity and negative words filter 
over it and then allows you to generate a codename.

The negative words were taken from a 40% likelihood of abusiveness on another profanity filter.

The purpose was to build a safe-for-work set of words to randomly generate a codename from.
